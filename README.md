# VCPU
Fun CPU emulator I am building for fun.
Not following any existing architecture. Just doing whatever feels right. 

This project will comprise of three main components.

 * VCPU Emulator - an implenetation of my make believe processor.
 * VCPU Assembler - an assembler capible of building projects written for the emulator.
 * VCPU Test Projects - a number of buildable test projects for the assembler to build and for the emulator to run.
